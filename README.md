LSTM-Based Sequence Prediction System with FastAPI Deployment
Project Overview
This project implements a Sequence Prediction System using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
The model is trained to predict the next word in a sequence using a text dataset.

The trained deep learning model is deployed using FastAPI, allowing real-time predictions via API endpoints.

This project demonstrates a complete AI pipeline including:

Dataset preprocessing
Sequence generation
LSTM model training
Model evaluation
API deployment
Objectives
Build a deep learning model using LSTM
Predict the next word in a sentence
Deploy the model using FastAPI
Demonstrate real-time AI inference through API endpoints
Dataset Used
Dataset: Tiny Shakespeare Dataset

Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt

This dataset contains dialogues from Shakespeare's plays and is widely used for sequence prediction tasks.

Example dataset text:

First Citizen: Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

Data Preprocessing
The dataset was preprocessed using the following steps:

1. Text Cleaning
Converted text to lowercase
Removed punctuation and special characters
Example:

My Lord, I will not hear you speak.

After cleaning:

my lord i will not hear you speak

2. Tokenization
Each word is converted into a numerical index using a tokenizer.

Example:

my lord i will not hear you speak

Tokenized sequence:

[34, 120, 5, 87, 22, 56, 13, 90]

3. Sequence Generation
Training sequences are generated as input-output pairs.

Example sentence:

my lord i will not hear

Generated sequences:

my lord → i my lord i → will my lord i will → not my lord i will not → hear

4. Padding
Since sequence lengths vary, padding is applied to make them uniform.

Example padded sequence:

[0, 0, 34, 120, 5, 87]

Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of the following layers:

Embedding Layer ↓ LSTM Layer ↓ Dropout Layer ↓ LSTM Layer ↓ Dense Output Layer

Layer Description
Embedding Layer

Converts word indices into dense vectors
LSTM Layer

Learns sequential dependencies
Dropout Layer

Prevents overfitting
Dense Layer

Predicts probability of next word
LSTM Mathematical Model
LSTM uses gates to control information flow.

Forget Gate
ft = σ(Wf[ht−1, xt] + bf)

Input Gate
it = σ(Wi[ht−1, xt] + bi)

Candidate Memory
C̃t = tanh(Wc[ht−1, xt] + bc)

Cell State Update
Ct = ft * Ct−1 + it * C̃t

Output Gate
ot = σ(Wo[ht−1, xt] + bo) ht = ot * tanh(Ct)
